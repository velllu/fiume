# Fiume
Fiume is a lisp-powered video meta-search engine. You can specify the websites you want to see using Scheme (Steel specifically). With just two catches:
- The websites must not load the video with javascript
- The website must load an actual video file, so, no "blob" files
# Future features
- [ ] Watched media tracker
- [ ] Using something like pupeeteer to run JS, to make more websites parseable
- [ ] Watch parties with multiple accounts
